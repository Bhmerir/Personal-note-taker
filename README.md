# Personal Note Taker

## Description 
---

Nowadays, there are lots of distractions in eveybody's lives which makes them not be reminded of every single tasks that they should do. Then having access to a personal note taker to keep track of the routine duties can be so helpful. This application is designed to support people to organize their ordinary tasks without being worried about forgetting them, and it is a full-stack application that handles both client side and server part.

<br>

In order to achieve this goal, I took the following steps:

<br>

1. design a router to answer all the requests of the user (get, post, and delete requests)

2. show all the saved notes when the link of the note page is clicked

3. save the new note to the list of notes which is kept in a json file after pressing save button

4. add new note in the shown list of notes

5. give a unique id to each new task

6. show each existing note in the right hand column when its title in left column is clicked

7. present the empty fields in order to write a new note after pressing write icon

8. delete each note if its delete button is cilcked and update the shown list
